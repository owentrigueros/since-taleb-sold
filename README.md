# BTC since Taleb sold bot

A (mildly successful) [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/sincetalebsold) that keeps track of the change of BTC since [Nassim Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb) sold in early 2021.

## Why?

Nassim Taleb sold his bitcoin between February and March 2021. Bitcoin kept rising for some time since Taleb sold and pro-bitcoiners started tweeting about how much it went up since then. Later, after some price crashes, they went silent. This bot has been made just to continue with their duty, without depending on whether it goes up or down.
